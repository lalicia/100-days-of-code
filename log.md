# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Attended Day 1 of SoC Bootcamp, worked on some CSS challenges we started during the day.

**Thoughts:** I've only done very basic CSS so far as part of the pre-learning for the bootcamp, so a lot of the things I saw today were new to me.  As we were working in a pair/group during the day, occassionally I felt things escaped me a little, so I wanted to go back over this myself.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
