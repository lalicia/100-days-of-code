# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 10: May 4, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 10 of SoC Bootcamp, more events in JS and an intro to APIs

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- The pace today took a little step back, with the morning being largely a recap of what we covered yesterday, which I really appreciated
- We then started to look at asynchronicity with setTimeout and setInterval
- The afternoon session introduced more concepts that looked at asynchronous coding with JS, looking at using fetch with APIs (and introducing APIs)
- My partner and I actually finished the workshop tasks in the workshop time (first time that's happened for me!)

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- I actually don't feel like I picked up much code today sadly, a lot of that was a bit over my head, I do however, feel like I understood the concepts, and I think maybe that's a win in itself
- I'll definitely need to look more at how things are achieved with the coding when using async functions and etc...  Functions...  *sigh*


### Day 9: May 3, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 9 of SoC Bootcamp, the DOM and events in Javascript

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- The day started really well with a guest panel of past bootcampers who all now work at Wise.  They were a lovely group of people and listening to them was so relatable, especially Joy, whose comments I adored and who made me feel so much better.  Lots of reassurance about sticking with it and about imposter syndrome being normal
- THEN the morning session introducing the DOM...  Well.  Yeah.  That was interesting.  I definitely need to finish reading the article on it, and maybe find a youtube video in the morning, because I still don't really get it
- THEN the afternoon session compounded my lack of understanding about things we'd covered by going over events in Javascript.  Some of the things spoken about actually made sense, but dealing with them in code was a whole other thing
- It was a really long day, and after that I had a meeting with my lovely mentor, Aidan - and felt bad because I had a headache and was trying to be engaged and not a numbskull.  Hopefull it worked.  We chatted a good hour, in which he reassured my about some industry questions I'd had, and he'd prepared a little demo to explain CSS positioning to me, which I thought was really sweet and thoughtful.  Having a mentor so willing to help and so aproachable is really great
- After the meeting it was back to Zoom to try and finish off the day's tasks...  I'm not gonna lie, I'm exhausted, finally getting off Zoom at about 8:30pm

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- I did some freeCodeCamp this morning on Javascript to try and just sink some basics in a bit more, I think some things are getting clearer
- The new stuff we did today with the DOM and events...I'm witholding judgement, because I felt lost but I also by the end of the forever-Zoom, felt like some bits were starting to go in...


### Day 8: May 2, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 8 of SoC Bootcamp, Bank Holiday Monday woo!

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- No bootcamp today, but looked again at the tasks we were set, with some Codewars and freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- As above really...spent about 4/5 hours looking at things, but honestly they didn't feel like very productive/successful hours.  I think I need to move on from things that completely baffle me before sinking so much time into being lost


### Day 7: May 1, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 7 of SoC Bootcamp, but it's a Sunday so...chillin

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- Gonna start nil-ing these bits on the weekend, apart from stuff like today where I helped another bootcamper on Zoom for a while with something they were stuck with (getting a password to limit at 10 characters)
- Felt good to feel helpful

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- I didn't do the freeCodeCamp I'd been planning on doing, but instead I started looking at and working on the Codewars katas we've been set.  I managed to do 3 of them but 1 of the initial 4 we were set was baffling.  I've got a video I'm going to watch on it tomorrow and hopefully I'll be able to follow that through
- I did see a feature on Codewars to 'practice' and apparently you can focus on a specific bit to do the katas on, so that might be good - I will investigate more tomorrow


### Day 6: April 30, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 6 of SoC Bootcamp, it's the weekend but there ain't no rest for the slow

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- No bootcamp on a weekend, but the spirit was there; worked on finishing the tasks from the week that I hadn't completed, between 15:30 and 21:15.  So when I say there's no rest, I mean it
- I was struggling BIGTIME refactoring some code into a function, but thankfully a call for help was answered on Slack by the awesome Matt D, who took some time out of his Saturday night to go through the mess I'd created and help me shape it into a FUNCTIONing password checker
- Prior to getting stuck bigtime, I'd actually been feeling pretty pleased with myself...just goes to show, never be happy folks, it's an illusion

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- There are some things I'm picking up but definitely others I'm struggling with.  But you know what?  I look at what I've accomplished in the last few days and sure, I could beat myself up about it taking me forever in comparison to others, but f*** that - I'm pleased with what I've been able to do.  Do I wish I could do more?  Sure - but that's pretty standard of life so whatever
- Tomorrow I'm going to look at freeCodeCamp and really focus on functions, loops, and if statements
- Depending on how long that takes me, the plan would then be a bit of Codewars (which scares me, because last time I looked at that I hadn't got a clue what was going on)


### Day 5: April 29, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of SoC Bootcamp, first Hackathon!

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- Today was our first Hackathon, where we spend all day on a project to then discuss and look over at the end in a group
- Abdi and I did pretty well and I was happy to get the functions going at the beginning, but some of the later stuff was new and/confusing...
- Not gonna lie, I had a little cry at the end of the day when not for love nor money could I get something to work.  Hamza (coach at SoC) spent a bit of time with me after the wrap up and helped me, and I really appreciated it (I didn't cry on Hamza btw, it was a private cry lol - don't worry, he's fine)
- Also had an into meeting with Rikia who's my enablement coach; was a nice little chat and he was really reassuring.  Did feel bad I apparently gave him the worst confidence score (2.5 out of 5) from his group, but I'm a truth-teller lol
- Was quite upset we had weekend assignments to do, as I can see at my pace I won't have any time off :disappointed: I was going to be looking at stuff anyways but yeah, now I feel quite pressured.  Life is hard, yo

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- Javascript will always be a lot, but when you get something to work the feeling of pride is immense
- I forked the Hackathon afterwards to work on it on my own to try and progress, and I did some on it this evening and got another couple of tasks done, which made me feel much happier and less wobbly


### Day 4: April 28, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of SoC Bootcamp, more Javascript and some mindset coaching.

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
- This morning we had our first mindset session, focussed on feedback, and I found that really good and timely after a pretty tough day yesterday
- We discussed the Hero's Journey, which reconated HARD, and also the good and bad way of giving/receiving feedback
- We recapped yesterday's Javascript then moved on to looking at Objects and Arrays; felt kind of ok on Objects until I didn't (lol) and Arrays...not so bad until starting to work with them and loops (While and For)
- Am pleased with the fact that I have learned some stuff, but still feel like a lot of stuff is going over my head
- Need to focus more on the computational thinking and breaking things down...may also need a new brain coz this one's tired and it's only Day 4 lol

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- Javascript continues to be a lot, but I do like it
- Loops, I do not like
- I had a look at Codewars (which I managed to finally get onto by passing the test) but the training exercises are all like WHAAAAAAT?  So I think I have some ways to go before I'm going to be able to be effective there
- I'm going to have a look at some youtube and try and get more of a handle on Loops


### Day 3: April 27, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of SoC Bootcamp, started looking at Javascript.

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:**
Going to make these a little more succint because words...
- Started to look at Javascript and tbh, a lot of it went over my head.  We worked on a password checker and I think if we hadn't had some help from the very clevel Brycen, we'd still be scratching our heads
- Had the worst headache ever by the end of the day
- Met with my mentor and had a really good conversation; he's a really nice guy and what he said was a real comfort after a somewhat meh day of feeling like the worst coder ever

**Thoughts on the 'coding':**
- Javascript is a lot
- Loops have me foxed: I went and watched a handful of videos that night and tbh I'm not sure how much I gleaned from them
- I still felt itchy about the CSS positioning, so I watched some more on that, and while I am far from knowing what to do, I do understand it a little better

### Day 2: April 26, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of SoC Bootcamp, worked on CSS koala and git/GitHub push-pull.

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:** The morning session covered a recap of html layout, the concepts of tags and requirements for instructing the computer.  We looked at VS Code - how it works, the terminal, some of the features.  There was a talk about code vs. programming vs. software engineering, and an intro to the concept of DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) and making things as simple as you can - avoiding repetition.  We looked at the Netflix site and Chris went over how it could be broken down into parts so that the idea of creating it wasn't really that intimidating, and then Abdi and I looked at the Amazon site and did likewise.

Abdi and I did some more pair coding, trying to replicate a koala in CSS.  We were supposed to be looking at the principle of breaking things down, so we went about that by first trying to create some of the shapes we needed, before tackling their positioning.

The afternoon session was focussed on using git and GitHub, practicing the rhythm of add - commit - push - pull.  Chris then gave a recap as quite a few of us were finding it tricky.

I'd made a mistake in the morning by creating a repo in my root folder, so I spent a bit of time panicking and sorting that out, but hopefully I've now learned and won't be doing that again!  Was very tired by the end of the day, but at least I looked it and my mum offered to get fish and chips lol  Win?

**Thoughts on the 'coding':** We didn't do too bad with the CSS koala but I'm not understanding the positioning of elements so I'm going to go back over that with some youtube tutorials I think.


### Day 1: April 25, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Attended Day 1 of SoC Bootcamp, worked on some CSS challenges we started during the day.

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:** The morning session gave us all an introduction to School of Code and set out the principles it's founded on.  It resonated with me so much I went downstairs at lunch and told my mum, and honestly was a little emosh.  I wrote down something Chris said because it really struck a chord: this is about "becoming the type of person you want to become".

That's exactly it.  But anyways, not to get too deep...

I also met my 'pair' - Abdi - who seems very nice.  We had a chat to get to know each other, and then later on tried a bit of pair-coding.  That's a little strange to start with, just because it doesn't feel quite natural I suppose, but we did ok!  We looked at CSS selectors, but the exercise was more to get us into the dynamics of working together than the coding itself.

We also met other members of our group, which I think will be the group we work in going forward.  It was a bit strained at first, and honestly I think that maybe we just need more time to 'gel'.  But everyone was nice, and we're all here for the same reason - we even wrote a poem about it lol  (it was a task given to us, we didn't just to off on one and decide to get whimsical)

The afternoon session was focussed on an introduction to the SoC way of thinking - computational thinking - and the idea of breaking things down into more manageable and approachable tasks.

Horse-sized duck, or 100 x duck-sized horses?  You had to be there, but it was a fun conversation.

Honestly, as it got toward the end of the afternoon I really started to feel tired.  We hadn't really done much that was technical, but this whole day was something new and a different experience, which in-and-of itself was surprisingly taxing.  Plus, I hate being on camera and I think I made myself extra tired by trying to look innocuous instead of resting-bitch-facey all day...

**Thoughts on the 'coding':** I've only done very basic CSS so far as part of the pre-learning for the bootcamp, so a lot of the things I saw today were new to me.  As we were working in a pair/group during the day, occassionally I felt things escaped me a little, so I wanted to go back over this myself.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
