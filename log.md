# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Attended Day 1 of SoC Bootcamp, worked on some CSS challenges we started during the day.

**Thoughts on the day at bootcamp:** The morning session gave us all an introduction to School of Code and set out the principles it's founded on.  It resonated with me so much I went downstairs at lunch and told my mum, and honestly was a little emosh.  I wrote down something Chris said because it really struck a chord: this is about "becoming the type of person you want to become".

That's exactly it.  But anyways, not to get too deep...

I also met my 'pair' - Abdi - who seems very nice.  We had a chat to get to know each other, and then later on tried a bit of pair-coding.  That's a little strange to start with, just because it doesn't feel quite natural I suppose, but we did ok!  We looked at CSS selectors, but the exercise was more to get us into the dynamics of working together than the coding itself.

We also met other members of our group, which I think will be the group we work in going forward.  It was a bit strained at first, and honestly I think that maybe we just need more time to 'gel'.  But everyone was nice, and we're all here for the same reason - we even wrote a poem about it lol  (it was a task given to us, we didn't just to off on one and decide to get whimsical)

The afternoon session was focussed on an introduction to the SoC way of thinking - computational thinking - and the idea of breaking things down into more manageable and approachable tasks.

Horse-sized duck, or 100 x duck-sized horses?  You had to be there, but it was a fun conversation.

Honestly, as it got toward the end of the afternoon I really started to feel tired.  We hadn't really done much that was technical, but this whole day was something new and a different experience, which in-and-of itself was surprisingly taxing.  Plus, I hate being on camera and I think I made myself extra tired by trying to look innocuous instead of resting-bitch-facey all day...

**Thoughts on the 'coding':** I've only done very basic CSS so far as part of the pre-learning for the bootcamp, so a lot of the things I saw today were new to me.  As we were working in a pair/group during the day, occassionally I felt things escaped me a little, so I wanted to go back over this myself.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
